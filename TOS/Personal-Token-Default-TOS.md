# Default Personal Token Terms of Service

**Terms of Service for $[[token name]]**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a binding legal agreement between each person who holds or has redeemed $[[token name]] tokens ("you") and [[consultant name]] ("Consultant"). $[[token name]] tokens exist on the Ethereum blockchain at 0x[[contract address]].

**Acquiring $[[token name]]**

1. By acquiring or holding $[[token name]], you have the following rights:

    i. to redeem $[[token name]] for Consultant’s services; and
    
    ii. to sell, transfer, lend, gift, burn or otherwise deal with $[[token name]] tokens as you see fit. This right is enforced by the $[[token name]] smart contract and the Ethereum blockchain and is noted here for completeness.

2. These Terms do not impose any obligations or liability on you if all you do is acquire, buy, sell or hold $[[token name]]. Redemption of $[[token name]] is subject to the terms set forth below.

**Minting and burning of $[[token name]]**

3. Consultant through LexDAO may mint more $[[token name]] at any time up to the overall issuance cap.

4. Consultant may burn any amount of $[[token name]] held by Consultant at any time. In the sole and complete discretion of LexDAO, the DAO may be able to recover and burn the token through a vote approved by the DAO. This will in cases of dispute be handled by LexDAO Arbitration or its assigns.
5. The above rights are enforced by the $[[token name]] smart contract and the Ethereum blockchain and are noted here for completeness.

**Redeeming $[[token name]]**

6. You can redeem $[[token name]] by sending it to 0x[[redeem address]].

7. You cannot redeem $[[token name]] for any services that:

    i. are not listed by Consultant or otherwise agreed between you and Consultant prior to redemption;
    
    ii. are prohibited by the laws or regulations of any jurisdiction(s) that you or Consultant are subject to; or
    
    iii. would require Consultant to assist in or provide advice about how to commit, or avoid detection or prosecution for the commission of, any illegal act in any jurisdiction.

8. If you attempt to redeem $[[token name]] in contravention of the requirements listed in section 7 above, Consultant reserves the right to refuse to provide Services and not refund any $[[token name]] that you have redeemed.

9. Unless otherwise agreed between you and Consultant in writing, payment for the Services must be paid [[start fifty percent]] percent upon entering into a statement of work and [[last fifty percent]] percent upon the delivery of the deliverables outlined in such statement of work. Each whole token is redeemable for a one (1) minute period of billable time by Consultant. No partial tokens may be redeemed.

10. In the event the time required to complete any of the Services is less than the amount of time paid for by you, Consultant will round up to the next full fifteen (15) minute period and then return any $[[token name]] paid by you for unused time.

11. In order to avoid any doubt, Consultant may require you to sign a message from the same Ethereum address that you redeemed $[[token name]] from. This will only be required if there is any doubt or dispute about the person(s) claiming to have made the redemption transaction.

12. Provided that the above criteria are met, Consultant agrees to provide professional services ("Services") to any person who redeems $[[token name]], on the terms set forth in these Terms.

13. Prior to the redemption of any $[[token name]] by you for the Services, you and Consultant must enter into a written statement of work that defines the scope of service, deliverables, and acceptance standards for any such deliverables.

14. $[[token name]] may not be redeemed for legal advice or legal representation, unless otherwise agreed between you and Consultant in writing prior to the redemption of your $[[token name]]. None of the Services shall otherwise constitute or be understood to be providing legal advice or counsel. None of the Services will create an attorney-client relationship between you and Consultant. Consultant retains the right to contract with other companies or entities for the Services without restriction.

**Independent Contractor Relationship**

15. Consultant's relationship with you will be that of an independent contractor, and nothing in these Terms intended to, or should be construed to create a partnership, agency, joint venture, or employment relationship. Consultant is not entitled to any employee benefits from you. Consultant will provide and use their own computer and all other equipment required to perform services for you.

**Fees**

16. Apart from redeeming $[[token name]], you do not have to pay any other fees for the Services.
