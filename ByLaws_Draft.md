# LexDAO Bylaws (DRAFT)

# Mission - Vote to Adopt Failed on 5.24.20 Likely Due to High gas Prices

 "LexDAO is a group of legal engineering professionals who are seeking to provide a trusted layer between the decentralized world of blockchains and a legal settlement layer in the real world. We are trying to bridge this layer to provide a working framework for organizations to work in a trustless and trusted manner using Ethereum, blockchains, smart contracts and decentralized organizations."

# What is the governing body?

LexDAO's legal "wrapper" is an unincorporated nonprofit.  This is important to maintain the mission of LexDAO and govern the relationship with the DAO with each other and outside world.  Concerns to be address highlighted with the very good resource from Gabriel Shapiro.  [https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1265316170975997953](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1265316170975997953).

The governing body of LexDAO consists exclusively of LexDAO community members.  Admission to the governing body requires at least two of the following: 

   1. Attend a weekly community call (Friday 11 PT / ET @ [https://zoom.us/j/6966768498)](https://zoom.us/j/6966768498)
   2. Write a blogpost about LexDAO (min. 500 words)
   3. Shill LexDAO consistently, e.g., tweet/retweet/meme about LexDAO
   4. Build for LexDAO, e.g., front and back end support, improve LexDAO's not-your-lawyer office, build/automate/improve/organize legal workflow via smart contracts and other engineering tools
   5. Offer services using LexDAO products
   6. Vouched by an incumbent governing member

To signal an intent to join LexDAO, prospective members must tweet at LexDAO (@lex_DAO). An example of such tweet may be `I am not a robot ðŸ¤– and I pledge to join @lex_DAO`.

All LexDAO governing members will receive one LDM (LexDAO Member Token). LDM is a vote token for participating in and improving governance of LexDAO. Once the admission requirements are met the prospective member is put up to a vote of the full LDM membership. The governing body will consistently review, and if necessary, make adjustments to the admission requirements based on its evolving needs. 

The governing body will use Aragon ([https://nightly.aragon.org/#/lexdao](https://nightly.aragon.org/#/lexdao)) to conduct its governance. LexDAO's Aragon Agent is located at 0x97103fda00a2b47eac669568063c00e65866a633. The governing body will cast votes and carry out the decisions made on Aragon. Members of the governing body can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GNQ53y5sYPwPrAXUrNxBrAobyl-7a4jBONdIz_DxVbE/edit#gid=629083965). 

# What do we want to do?

- **Maintain LexDAO platforms,** e.g., [lexdao.club](https://lexdao.club/), [cryptovoxel](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/2223), to enable offering of:
    - Consulting/governance/ADR services
    - Legal research services
    - Fixed fee products
    - White labeling
    - Legal representation services
        - On individual basis -
- **Advance legal engineering**
    - Research & Development - legal & engineering
    - Provide mechanism and platforms for "safety rails" for certain assets, through code, governance, and ADR.
- **Encourage community participation**
- **Build sustainable workflow** within LexDAO / Minimize frictions to decentralized governance
    - Members donate XXX personal tokens on recurring basis to support LexDAO operations, e.g., ETH drip/drop.
    - Any excess amount of tokens, e.g., > $1,000 in LexDAO bank, will be redistributed monthly proportional to individual donations
- Open source all of the above
    - Documentation

# How do we do them?

Each governing member is represented by her Ethereum address. Governing members are not required to cast a vote on every vote topic, but are encouraged to do so. 

**All vote topics must have the following characteristics:** 

1. A duration of at least 24 hours
2. Relative support % of 50% (majority support of votes cast)
3. Minimum approval % of 10% (this is of full DAO.  So a 100 LDM membership requires 10 votes.)
4. A clear description or additional information supporting vote, ideally passed into Telegram and/or Discord

Characteristics are subject to change as the LexDAO governing body sees fit. 

# What we don't want to do?

1. LexDAO is not a law firm, it is a community
    - Prohibitions on fee sharing, confidentiality, and would be unable to onboard attorneys that are at firms
2. LexDAO is not limited to any jurisdiction, it is global
3. LexDAO does not discriminate, it welcomes everyone, including Web3 beginners 
4. Unless approved by a vote, members of LexDAO, governing and community members alike, do not and cannot act on behalf of LexDAO
