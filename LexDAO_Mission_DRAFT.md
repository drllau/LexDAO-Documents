# LexDAO Mission Statement 
LexDAO is a non-profit association of legal engineering professionals. Our mission is to research, develop and evangelize first-class methods and protocols that secure rules and promises with code rather than trusted third-parties. We strive to bridge deterministic settlement tools like blockchains smart contracts with the traditions and equitable considerations of state-enforced law to better serve our clients and allies.
