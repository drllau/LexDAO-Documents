# LexDAO Mission Statement 

We believe that everyone deserves access to justice. If legal services were easier to use, verify, and enforce we could live in a fairer world. Blockchain technology offers solutions to many problems in the legal space. LexDAO bridges the gap between the blockchain and the legal settlement layer. We do this by training and certifying legal engineers and creating legally compliant Ethereum applications.
