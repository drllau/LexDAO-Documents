# LexDAO Mission Statement 
LexDAO is a non-profit association of legal engineering professionals. Our mission is to develop first-class methods and protocols that  secure rules and promises with code. To succeed, we will share our works, educate, research, train and strive to provide a trusted layer between the decentralized world of blockchains and the traditional (legal) settlement layer.
